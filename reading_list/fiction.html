        Recently purchased novels:

        I've had the wonderful opportunity to listen to Art Spiegelman talk about his work on Maus. I've owned Maus part II for almost as long as I can remember, and picking up Maus part 1 and Maus Now has been a wonderful experience. I look forward to both.


        Recent fiction novels:

        <h3>Foundation by Isaac Asimov</h3>
        <p>
          Foundation is bizaare to read in 2022. Everything is so simply parallel to the 1940s world that Asimov existed in that many of the tropes of future technology simply don't exist yet.
          Everything is "nuclear butter knives" and "nuclear washing machines," and so the bare metaphors of what Asimov is tell the reader are incredibly accessible.
          The idea of a civilization that could transcend the stars but not produce nuclear fuel is utterly mindmelting in our current star-trek informed notion of science fiction.
          
          12/10
        </p>

        <h3>Cryptonomicon by Neil Stephenson</h3>

        <p>
          Cryptonomicon was a fascinating read. I felt rather disappointed by the ending, but I suppose there's not really much more the plot could have done beyond the giant pile of gold advertised throughout most of the book.
          I really enjoyed some of the sections concerning cryptological warfare, like how when they meet with the Japanese soldier from the b-plot and reveal a subset of the digits they have, or the whole deal with the van eck phreaking box in the philipino prison. 
          Stephenson stays memorable as always, 4/5.

        <h3> 
          Float Plan by Trish Doller
        </h3>
        <p>
          David Reads A Romance Novel. 

          Anna is insufferable, out of control, kind of an impulsive moron, and falls into an incredibly level of fantasy. Charming Irish lad named Keane? 
          Irish people don't actually exist, they're just a conspiracy by the British government to convince people that anyone from those fetid islands could be attractive. /s. 
          Going to the Caribbean instead of _going to therapy?_ oh my god. 
          Keane is missing part of his leg after a traffic accident. Somehow, having a leg prothetic means the man gets discriminated against as a sailor, even though he should be covered by some Carribean version of ADA. The man can swim, and yet apparently everyone thinks his lack of leg means he can't. 
          It renders him emotionally vulnerable, and sets the stage for their meeting, because Anna is an awful captain and needs someone to escort her.
          They travel the Islands, steadily falling in love and coming to terms with Anna's grief from her ex boyfriend's suicide.
          There's too much forehead smooching before they actually kiss. It really ruins the tension. 
          To accompany this work, I also listened to Golbin Girl Maid Service on Audible, which to my surprise, was just straight up porn after a while.
          In GGMS, whour protagonist gets hit by a truck and is isekai-ed to a generic fantasy world where 5' goblin girls with large titties consider generic human males their type in a fantasy version of race fetishization.
          By chapter 10, we're just getting description of Green-Girl sloppy top. 
          How this is legal to put on Audible without any censorship is beyond me.
          Now Float Plan is also porn, but with a more emotionally slow take, so that you don't have the stigma of porn, but they're both for the libido. Sex acts are described, if glossed over. Honestly, kinda disappointed that we didn't get a chapter long description of all the various stages, including some actual boundary setting. 


          Float plan taps into a modern womans fantasies of international travel, having a partner who is seemingly a mind reader, owning a place to live(boat), and fucking your subordinates. <b>DID I MENTION KEANE IS TECHNICALLY EMPLOYED FOR A JOB BY HER?</b>
          Goblin Girl Maid Service taps into the modern male fantasy of getting sloppy top by a busty, short woman with a video game collection.
          Honestly, I think Goblin Girl Maid Service offers the more realistic fantasy, if only because sex work and green body paint are probably cheapter than a month long trip through the Caribbean, especialy given that Anna was working as a bartender at Pirate Hooters prior to leaving.
