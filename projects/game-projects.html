                <h3>Anarchy Chess</h3>
                <div style="display: flex; float: left; max-width: 80%;">
                    <p> There's a subreddit, r/anarchychess where most of the content funny memes about fictional new
                        rules for chess.
                        Simultaneously, "Fairy" chess modifications to normal chess exist, but no one really plays them.
                        Many of the anarchy chess variations are simply comedic variations on Fairy Chess pieces.
                        Many of the variants seem fun, but a common issue I find with Chess variations(Chess+ springs to
                        mind) is that they require different pieces than a normal set, and can fiddle with your mental
                        understanding of the game.
                        My concept is therefore a deck of cards with simple variations to normal chess, and each game a
                        small number(2-3) get applied to the current game.

                        <br>
                        
                        Current status is that I've got a set of about 15 or so rules and I'm whittling down ideas to a core set that preserves gameplay balance with still resembling normal chess

                <h3>Untitled Trading Figure Game</h3>
                <p>
                    I was a massive fan of the Fire Emblem series growing up, as well as its close cousin, Advance Wars.
                    Both games offered a brutal, grid based stategy experieces that provided hours of enjoyment. 
                    Advance wars provided a more sophisticated experience similar in many ways to Axis and Allies or Risk, while Fire Emblem offered a miniature of Dungeons and Dragons gameplay.
                    New technologies can provide an entirely new layer of flavor and enjoyment to strategy gaming.
                    3D Printing, a common hobby in this technical, analytic demographic of strategy gamers, can provide a fun and flexible way for the sorts of figurines associated with bigger cousins like Warhammer 40k to be brought to a wider audience. 
                    During college, I was also hooked into another game called Pokemon Duel, a mobile adaptation of a failed Pokemon Trading Figurine game. 
                    Duel proved that there was a market for the underlying game, but TFGs have often had issues with the sheer bulk and of delivery of figurines to customers.
                    Again, 3D printing resolves this issue by transferring the issue of bulk and delivery to the end user.
                </br>
                    In short, I envison a game which can conjoin the rapidly evolving metagames of TCGs, with the accessibility of games far less complicated than Warhammer. 
                    Players would purchase booster packs of cards, these cards would have QR codes that link to a 3D model of the figurine, so that they can be printed out and also perhaps painted at home.
                    The cards are used for summoning troops, and also act as tokens to verify ownership of troops. 
                    Gameplay would then proceed along the lines of a Fire Emblem game or Advance wars, where each figure's differing movement pattern, strengths, and "elemental" abilities would impact strategies for victory in a 2 player combat scenario.

                    Current status is "on"
